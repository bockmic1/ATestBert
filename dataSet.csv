"We can now officially put to rest all comparisons of COVID-19 to influenza. Coronavirus is killing more Americans than the flu and almost everything else. According to data compiled by the Washington Post, COVID-19 is now the second-leading cause of death in America.
The upward march of these numbers is steady and disturbing. The week of March 16, COVID-19 didn‚Äôt rank among the 15 most common causes of death. The next week, it ranked seventh. The following week, it moved up to third. The week of April 6, COVID-19 killed more people than anything besides heart disease.
These numbers are a tragic milestone, and they‚Äôre also a verdict on attempts to downplay the severity of this event. Messaging from political leaders and some media voices early in this outbreak comparing it to the flu were wrong. They might have been well-intentioned efforts to keep people from panicking, but that point is moot now.
Coronavirus is the most formidable public health threat in a generation. The time for minimizing is over. The time for aggressive testing, social distancing and (hopefully soon) treatment is now.","Real"

‚Äú.@FoxNews is no longer the same. We miss the great Roger Ailes. You have more anti-Trump people, by far, than ever before. Looking for a new outlet!‚Äù President Trump tweeted. Speaking to reporters at the White House, President Trump revealed that he‚Äôs been taking a hydroxychloroquine pill daily for roughly a week and a half, along with a dose of zinc. Shortly after the announcement, The Your World with Neil Cavuto anchor called the president‚Äôs remarks ‚Äústunning‚Äù and warned that the drug could kill certain individuals who consume the drug.

Cavuto said:

A number of studies, those certainly vulnerable in the population have one thing to lose, their lives. A VA study showed that among a population of veterans in a hospital receiving this treatment, those with vulnerable conditions, respiratory conditions, heart elements, they died.

Those who took it, in a vulnerable population, including those with respiratory or other conditions, they died. I want to stress again ‚Äî they died. If you are in a risky population here and you are taking this as a preventative treatment to ward off the virus or, in a worst-case scenario, you are dealing with the virus, and you are in this vulnerable population, it will kill you. I cannot stress that enough. This will kill you.","Fake"
"Santa Ana, California, is experiencing a surge in crime as suspects exploit a national recommendation to wear masks to prevent the spread of the Chinese coronavirus.

The Santa Ana Police Department told CBS News Los Angeles that the city has seen a 50 percent spike in robberies since California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) announced a sweeping stay-at-home order in March. Speaking to the news outlet, one gas station clerk recounted how he was held up at gunpoint by a masked thief last Friday at 2 a.m.

The clerk said the suspect didn‚Äôt arouse suspicion because mask coverings are now the norm, allowing the thief to catch him off guard when he pulled a gun on him and took his cash before getting away in a silver Nissan Altima.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs horrible,‚Äù the clerk lamented. ‚ÄúI mean, I know we have to take certain measures because of what‚Äôs happening with COVID-19, but it‚Äôs the perfect script or manual for a robber ‚Äî the mask, the sunshade, and a hoodie.

Mims appeared on the Trevor Carey Show, discussing the challenges facing law enforcement during the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the economic hardship. She pointed out that government employees were also vulnerable to the economic damage, because the decline in tax revenues meant that state and local governments would cut services.

Carey asked her: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard multiple sheriffs around the nation-state they will not enforce their governors‚Äô shelter-in-place orders. Is that your position?

‚ÄúThat is my position. We do not stop the public to find out what they‚Äôre doing when they‚Äôre not sheltering in place. We don‚Äôt ask those questions, we don‚Äôt ask if they‚Äôre ‚Äòessential‚Äô.

AntiCancer‚Äôs oral recombinant methioninase targets and destroys circulating methionine in the body. Methionine is a common amino acid derived from protein-containing food. Oral methioninase has been shown to have great promise for treating cancer, obesity and diabetes by restricting methionine in the body. It is known that virally-infected cells are killed by methionine restriction. Importantly, coronaviruses have a specific requirement for methionine in order to replicate and to evade the immune system of the host.
‚ÄúOral recombinant methioninase has high potential to slow or arrest infection of 2019-nCoV in patients, with and without symptoms,‚Äù said Dr. Qinghong Han, methioninase project leader at AntiCancer. ‚ÄúWe will first test methioninase in cultured lung cells infected with 2019-nCoV in vitro, and then test oral recombinant methioninase in patients infected with the virus. We will carry out these tests in China with the appropriate organizations and safety profiles. Oral recombinant methioninase should be effective therapy for 2019-nCoV disease since coronaviruses have a special requirement for methionine,‚Äù said Dr. Han.

"Coronaviruses are common throughout the world. They can infect people and animals. A novel (new) coronavirus that was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, has been identified in a growing number of other international locations , including the United States . The actual number of cases in mainland China is likely much higher than that reported to date. According to some estimates , there to be around 58,000 cumulative cases in mainland China by the end of January (as of January 31, the reported cases are close to 12,000). The disease situation changes so rapidly, these numbers are outdated. The total case number today is closer to 30,000 with close to 600 deaths. Any discrepancy in the numbers is likely due to reporting delays. Also, the majority of the cases may be mild (or asymptomatic), do not require seeking medical care, and thus are not reported. The good news is that the death rate did not increase and remains at about 2 %.
Following the above reasoning, it should be expected that there are (and have been) already many cases in other countries, but these may be "indeterminate" and hopefully mild or asymptomatic. Could many cases have been previously diagnosed as "common" influenza, or another viral pneumonia, for instance. This is a complex issue, indeed.
As for more detailed medical/microbial/Immuno/etc. information, there is a proliferation now, and some are quite good, impressively rapid in what people have been able to produce in the short time frame of mainly early to late January.

The virus causes illnesses ranging from common cold to acute respiratory syndromes. A total of 440 cases of pneumonia caused by the virus has been reported in China, Thailand, Japan and South Korea.

"The worst, possibly existential, threat is the stealthy, invisible one that multiplies exponentially‚Äîin the accurate sense of the term: 400 cases today, 800 tomorrow, then 1600, 3200, 6400, 128000, 256000, 512000, and 1.024 million after only eight doubling times. Biological threats proliferate‚Äîuntil they run out of susceptible victims.
In 1918, the great influenza pandemic killed as many people in 11 months as the medieval Black Death did in 4 years. Ultimately, at least 50 million may have perished. Young healthy people, especially young soldiers headed off to the front in World War I, succumbed quickly. To avoid interfering with the war effort, the U.S. government denied and covered up the threat, preventing the implementation of public health measures.
Since then, the world has gotten smaller. A virus that jumps the species barrier from animals to humans in a meat market in China can cross the Pacific in hours. And despite the expenditure of $80 billion on a National Biologic Defense, the U.S. is arguably no better prepared than it was in 1918, state Steven Hatfill, M.D., and coauthors in their new book Three Seconds until Midnight .
As in1918, we lack a vaccine or wonder drugs, but must rely on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), and on public health authorities to track and try to contain the spread of infection.
Accurate information is critical. Can we trust governmental authorities to tell the truth? Travel restrictions, quarantine, closing businesses, and cancelling public events have a huge economic and potential political cost.
There can also be incentives to exaggerate the threat, in order to sell poorly tested vaccines or drugs. The 1976 swine flu epidemic was almost a non-event; more people were probably injured or even died from adverse effects of the heavily promoted vaccine.","Real"

"Dandavats! All Glories to Sri Guru and Sri Gauranga! Announcement from MAYAPUR in relation to the Corona Virus Friday, 31 January 2020 / Published in Recent Media / 545 views
VERY IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT FROM MAYAPUR Dear Devotees,
Please accept our humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada, Guru and Gauranga.
Given the evolving situation in China with the deadly strain of the Corona Virus, we sincerely send our heartfelt prayers to our Lord Nrsingha Deva on behalf of all those affected.
After meeting with the Mayapur Community Hospital members and the Mayapur Management Committee, effective immediately we recommend the following:
Those who may want to come to Mayapur from China, or other countries and areas in close proximity to outbreaks of this virus, or those with any symptoms of fever, cough, runny nose or breathing difficulties to please refrain from coming to Mayapur until we are able to further advise you, given the evolving nature of this outbreak.
Though this news is certainly disheartening for all of us, we feel that this is in the best interest of all devotees during the coming festival season.
With love and prayers,","Fake"
"The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. Since the first reported case in the Wuhan city of China, 2019-nCoV has spread to other cities in China as well as to multiple countries across four continents. There is an imminent need to better understand this novel virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against 2019-nCoV by considering the high genetic similarity between 2019-nCoV and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to 2019-nCoV proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available 2019-nCoV sequences (as of 29 January 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against 2019-nCoV. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against 2019-nCoV.

"The Department of Health should be more open in communicating the risks of the new coronavirus after Manila recorded the first virus-related death outside China, the country of its origin, a public health expert said Monday.
Local health experts should be more proactive in updating the public on the diagnosis of monitored cases of the virus in the country to avoid public panic, Dr. Anthony Leachon, former director of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, said.
"Under the Data Privacy Act, you can actually tell people things for public safety so the people will not be surprised," he told ANC's "Headstart."
"We respect the privacy of course and human rights but we need to know," he added.
More people have been considered by the Philippine government as patients under investigation (PUIs), including those who interacted with the Chinese couple who tested positive for the new coronavirus.
Twenty-three of the patients are currently admitted and isolated, and 10 others have been discharged but still being monitored.
Of the PUIs, 6 and 24 were found negative based on specimen tests conducted in Australia and at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, respectively. Test results for four others from RITM remain pending.
Leachon explained that more health experts can help in finding ways to treat cases of the virus if there is more transparency in the diagnosis of the cases.
"The country wouldn't mind if you're transparent that you're actually investigating PUIs and the course of this patient," he added, noting a "gap" in terms of risk communication on the virus.

"The novel corona-virus won't cause a long-term setback to China 's economic growth, South African economists have said.
" China is a fast growing economy," and the virus "is likely to be a temporary setback in the immediate to short-term for most areas," Annabel Bishop , senior economist at Investec, told Xinhua recently.
Bishop said she was impressed with how the Chinese government has responded to the outbreak. "The Chinese government has made enormous, rapid progress in a number of areas to deal with the virus," the economist said.
"It is likely to continue this trajectory, and yield successes in conjunction with working closely with other countries in the development of vaccines and treatments, and also in communication and support," she added.
By noting that some countries have decided to suspend flights to China , Bishop said that the tourism sector would likely be influenced by that.
"Although it is by no means yet a full countrywide shut down, the precautionary measures will still have an impact on Chinese GDP (gross domestic product)," the economist added.
She stressed limiting the spread of the corona-virus would be good for China 's economic development. "A quick containment of the virus ... would be very beneficial." Jannie Rossouw, head of the school of Economic and business Sciences at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg , said he believes that the impact on the economy would be limited.

"Corona virus: A) Virology: 1) Coronaviruses are classified as a family within the Nidovirales order, viruses that replicate using a nested set of mRNAs. The coronavirus subfamily is further classified into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta coronaviruses. 2) Positive mRNA strand virus. It is largest known RNA strand. B) Routes of transmission ‚Äî Respiratory coronaviruses probably spread in a fashion similar to that of rhinoviruses, via direct contact with infected secretions or large aerosol droplets. Immunity develops soon after infection but wanes gradually over time. C) Clinical Manifestation: 1) Upper respiratory tract infections 2) Acute otitis media 3) Pneumonia 4) Temporarily linked to asthma attacks in both adults and children 5) The idea that coronaviruses produce diarrhea in humans is intriguing because of their clear intestinal pathogenicity in animals 6) Gastrointestinal manifestations -diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain. 7) There is one reported case of encephalitis due to corona virus 8)Also seen in association with Kawasaki disease. D) Diagnosis: Until recently, no sensitive, rapid method existed to detect all of the known human coronavirus strains. Rapid techniques that can be used to detect coronaviruses from nasopharyngeal samples include reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunofluorescence antigen detection assays. E) Treatment: 1) There is currently no treatment recommended for coronavirus infections except for supportive care as needed 2) Chloroquine has shown some activity against cultured cells.

For a biological weapon to be effective one must first design the weapon and then the antidote thus the weapon is a weapon against one self without the antidote.
You must first design the biological weapon and at at the same time design the antidote. Otherwise it kills your enemy and yourself. If this is a designed biological weapon it escaped from a military lab in error as there is no available cure for the disease at present. This may be a normal and severe pathogen as we have had in the past.
I doubt this.
This may be a biological weapon or not. I find it most strange that this particular virus is very contagious prior to symptoms.

In a recent Dubai Health Authority (DHA) circular issued to hospitals based on directives from the Ministry of Health and Prevention (Mohap), all DHA-licensed health facilities must consider suspected or confirmed cases of the 2019-nCoV as emergency cases.
The circular stated that all health facilities must classify the cases in two categories: one for those with insurance coverage and another where insurance coverage is unavailable.
"If the patient has insurance, the cases shall be treated as emergencies according to insurance regulation and insurance companies will honour any claims received," it noted.
Meanwhile, for those who are not insured, "the cases shall still be considered emergencies and suspected or confirmed cases will not bear any payment of healthcare costs at any healthcare facilities."
The move aims to ensure the health and safety of the community and to contain patients with confirmed or suspected infection, and provide them with proper health services. Ads

"Coronavirus (COVID-19) is not just a threat to human existence but also a real setback to the business world, especially to the airlines‚Äô industry.
Airlines have started counting huge losses as flights to the Asian countries have been halted to help fight the spread of the bloodthirsty Coronavirus.
A United Nations agency has reported that airlines could lose up to 502 billion shillings in revenue due to flight cancellations in and out of China as the world struggles to fight one of the deadliest disease outbreaks.
70 airlines have so far canceled their flights to China and some other parts of the Asian continent while 50 airlines have reduced their operations to the Corona-infested country resulting in huge losses in revenue.
Prior to the Coronavirus outbreak, airlines had planned to increase capacity by nine percent on international routes to and from China for the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, but instead, there has been a decline of almost 80 percent in passenger capacity since the virus started.
The ferocious coronavirus has so far killed about 1,400 people and 64,000 people have been infected mostly in China but is said to be spreading fast like a wildfire. Those reported outside China have been to the country.
Unlike the SARS epidemic that happened in 2002-2003, the UN agency says the Coronavirus is likely to pose serious threats to the airline industry, stating that flight cancellations are widespread.
Countries like Japan and Thailand are seen to be the most affected as they are likely to lose 1.2 billion dollars and 1.15 billion dollars respectively in tourism revenue.
China itself, the country where the coronavirus originated, is doing all it can to contain the disease. Chinese authorities have locked down Hubei province, the virus epicenter, and have restricted movements in several cities.
Some Governments like the US, Germany, UK, and Japan have also advised their citizens against traveling to China.","Real"

"New Mac Pro with lengthy delivery estimates, possibly due to corona virus New Mac Pro with lengthy delivery estimates, possibly due to corona virus Google + Last week we reported that many custom iMac, iMac Pro, and MacBook Pro configurations in Apple's online store in the US are being shipped longer than usual.
The reason for the delays is unconfirmed, but could be related to the outbreak of the Wuhan corona virus in China, which has forced many Apple suppliers to temporarily shut down their factories and cease production. While some factories are starting to resume operations, initial production appears to be limited.
In any case, the delay has extended to the new Mac Pro. In many European countries, for example, the delivery of the basic model without adjustments is currently scheduled for March 10. While the new Mac Pro is being assembled in the United States for orders in America, European orders are being assembled in China.
The new Mac Pro is expected to ship in the United States from February 24-26, although it will be assembled in Texas, possibly because some components are still available from temporarily closed suppliers in China.
The outbreak of the corona virus is a fluid situation, so it remains unclear what impact this could have on upcoming Apple products. Last month, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo outlined expectations for several new Apple products in the first half of 2020, including updated MacBook Pro / Air models, updated iPad Pro models with a three-lens rear camera system, and tile-like article tracking tags, wireless High-end headphones, a small wireless charging mat and a new, cheaper 4.7-inch iPhone.","Real"
"Nicotine to fight Covid-19 ‚Äì study says smokers have reduced risk of catching coronavirus 8 hours ago )
Can it really be that smoking tobacco, inhaling all that nicotine, reduces the risk of catching Covdi-19? Can smoking tobacco prevent really you from getting this hideous respiratory disease? A French suggests it‚Äôs true. Maybe.
A team at Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re hospital in Paris questioned 480 patients who tested positive for the coronavirus. Of the 350 ill enough to have been to warrant a prolonged stay in hospital ‚Äì median age: 65 ‚Äì just 4.4% were regular smokers. For those released home ‚Äì median age: 44 ‚Äì 5.3% smoked. But around 25% of French people are smokers. So either those with Covid-19 are liars ‚Äì you told the insurance company you don‚Äôt smoke, right? ‚Äì or maybe smoking is good for you?
A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine at the end of March said that only 12.6% of 1,000 patients were smokers, a figure that was significantly lower than expected. Some 28% of people in China are smokers.
French neurobiologist Jean-Pierre Changeux thinks nicotine might stop the virus from reaching cells in the body preventing its spread. Nicotine may also lessen the overreaction of the body‚Äôs immune system that has been found in the most severe cases of Covid-19 infection. To test the theory, frontline health workers, and hospital patients with the Covid-19 virus will be slapped with nicotine patches.
‚ÄúOur cross-sectional study strongly suggests that those who smoke every day are much less likely to develop a symptomatic or severe infection with Sars-CoV-2 compared with the general population,‚Äù say the Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re researchers. ‚ÄúThe effect is significant. It divides the risk by five for ambulatory patients and by four for those admitted to hospital. We rarely see this in medicine.‚Äù","Fake"

"So there is a new Corona Virus. Everyone is freaking out because the news media is blowing it up. My thoughts are, we really cannot stop it in the Bahamas if it is coming and definitely not by using racist policies that focus on a certain ethnicity. The major reason I think the ship has sailed is the incubation period. the averge is about 6 days (although the research is not yet peer reviewed, it seems robust). At a minimum, you need 2 days before symptoms show and up to 11 days can pass before symptoms start. In the mean time, the infected individual can pass the virus by coughing and sneezing, breathing on you etc. Or the classic cough in their hand and touch something you later touch. This means we would have to go back more than 11 days BEFORE the first case was identified and isolate all the people that person came into contact with in the prior 11 day period and maybe they got it from someone else. So, we woul dhave to go 11 days before that person got it. Plus there are other people who do not show symptoms, self medicate or actually can carry for a longer period without showing symptoms. There is no way we can find all these people and stop them. We can treat the symptoms. we can protect ourselves by staying away from crowds, washing our hands, and go see a medical professional as soon as you experience symptoms. No racist border policy will protect us. Remember that the USA has brought their citizens back into the country, there are cases throughout europe now and the spread in asia is fast.","Fake"
"Greg Cochran blogs :
I‚Äôve seen people compare the new coronavirus to influenza. Some have said that we should worry more about the flu, since it kills every year (maybe 10,000 in the US last year). They are mistaken. The danger in this case is not entirely clear, but on the high end, we‚Äôre talking big trouble, way bigger than current influenza strains.
Current flu strains seem much less severe that this new coronavirus, much less likely to put you in intensive care or kill you. Fewer people are susceptible to the flu: we have a vaccine, and most people already have some degree of immunity from vaccination and past bouts with the flu. We have somewhat useful antiviral drugs for the flu.
2019-nCoV: it‚Äôs new, nobody is immune. As yet we don‚Äôt know of antiviral drugs that are effective against it, although people are certainly trying out existing ones. Perhaps we will get lucky.

"Medical experts confirm that good immunity decreases a person‚Äôs risk of corona virus (2019-nCoV).
The body has a defense system as a natural mechanism to fight the threat of entry of foreign objects from outside. Like viruses, bacteria or fungi.
When the immune system is weak, then the foreign body will easily enter, causing infection and appear some symptoms such as sneezing, fever and others.
Because the corona virus vaccine has not yet been found, the best way to respond to the spread of this virus is to prevent both external and internal.
External patterns you can do by maintaining a clean and healthy lifestyle as follows.
Consumption of balanced nutritional food Exercise hard Enough rest Diligent hand washing with soap Use a mask Diligent hand washing, especially when in a crowded place Meanwhile, efforts to protect themselves internally can be done by modulating or regulating the immune system.
Immunostimulants in the form of immune booster supplements work to stimulate the formation of immune cells such as B cells which will then form antibodies.
In conditions where the risk of exposure to viral infections is very high, immunostimulants can be added in addition to other precautions.
Immunostimulants can be consumed in a certain duration until the risk of exposure to the virus decreases. Immunostimulants should be consumed before someone is infected with a disease, because immunostimulants need time to stimulate the immune system.
A good immunostimulants are those that contain Echinacea purpurea extract and zinc picolinate. The content of Echinacea purpurea extract has been clinically proven to modulate the immune system and prevent further spread of infection.
Meanwhile, Zinc Picolinate plays an active role and works synergistically on the immune system.
Imboost is an immunomodulatory product that is immunostimulant and contains Echinacea pupurea extract and Zinc picolinate.","Real"

" After seven confirmed cases of the corona virus in the U.S., health officials have declared a public health emergency nationwide Friday, just a day after the World Health Organization announced a global emergency because of the illness.
As Delta, American and United Airlines suspend all flights to China, KFBB decided to ask the Great Falls International Airport how staff are preparing for any potential pandemics.
As of Friday, the airport is waiting on word from official health and flight departments before making a move, but they do have emergency plans in place for most any situation.
While GFIA Director John Faulkner couldn't talk about the plans in detail out of security and privacy concerns, he said in-flight medical emergencies like chest pains may trigger the plan. In theory, if a passenger shows potential corona virus symptoms , the airport would work with local health authorities to quarantine them, according to Faulkner.
The chance of cases happening in Great Falls is significantly lower than most major hubs like Seattle, but Faulkner said you can't go wrong with a little preparation.
"Bring some chlorox wipes and you know wipe down the tray table. You know if you're going to be travelling on a flight that has entertainment screens, it's a good idea if you're touching the buttons, go ahead and wipe that down,‚Äù said the airport director. ‚ÄúBring some hand sanitizer so you can sanitize your hands on the flight."
Faulkner also recommends paying attention to health alerts as you make your travel plans, especially if you want to fly overseas. Corona virus cases have already been confirmed worldwide in the U.S., Canada, China, Southeast Asia and Australia.

Organizers, however, said the main event, Asia's biggest airshow, will proceed as scheduled from February 11 to 16 despite the pullout of several exhibitors, many of them from China.
The aviation industry is one of the most affected by the virus outbreak after governments worldwide imposed restrictions on travel, including bans on arrivals from China.
The death toll in China stood at 425 Tuesday, exceeding the number of fatalities in the country from the outbreak in 2002-03 of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS.

"Imagine what joy some people derive in playing with something as serious as death itself. On Monday, a flight from Canada that was going to Jamaica, was forced to abort mission and turn back, because a passenger on board pranked everyone on board that he had visited China and was infected with corona virus and was feeling unwell two hours into the flight.
The prankster James Potok Philipe thought it was funny to play this prank because he thought he could make a viral video out of this prank. He was immediately masked before he could infect anyone and the plane was taken back to canada where it was coming from and on emergency landing.
The prankster was checked for any sign of the virus, and after none was found on him by the medical team, he was charged to court for the mischief.
last week Saturday in Abuja, Nigeria, some young nigerians, about five Nigerians had gone to an Abuja hospital and pranked them that they had contacted the corona virus too. This sent every patient running helter skelter, before the pransters Peggi Shandi, Abayomi Adedoyin,David Enemigin, Priscilia Ajesola and Jacob Oji were arrested by the police and charged.
While these pranksters for selfish reasons might think its funny to play pranks with a disease that is epidemic and has infected more than 20,000 people in china and killed about 500 globally, some people think this kind of behaviour is really dumb, stupid and insensitive on other people.

As of January 24, 2020 at 3:00 p.m. WIB, there have been 85 confirmed cases of coronavirus transmission globally. 26 of them were declared dead. The first case was reported in December last year in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China.
Wuhan has a population of more than 11 million, more than the population of London or New York. The corona virus has now spread to Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and the United States.
This outbreak is thought to have originated from the fish market or the Huanan seafood market. The market has now been closed. The authorities had revealed that human-to-human transmission is unlikely to occur. But a few weeks after the Huanan market was emptied, it was announced that human-to-human transmission could occur.
Animal Meat Corona viruses represent a variety of viruses that exist in animals which in certain circumstances can move to humans.
Contact with meat from various animals sold on the market is stated as a possible cause of infection in humans.

"Corona virus that has given rise to travel restrictions in China is sending shockwaves through Asia‚Äôs tourism industry, which has become increasingly dependent on growing numbers of Chinese visitors.
At least 81 people have died since the new strain of corona virus emerged in China‚Äôs Wuhan, and millions are now under an effective quarantine, with all flights in and out of the city postponed. There is also a ban on Chinese tour groups domestically and abroad.
The measures come in the middle of a boom in Chinese foreign travel, with the number of tourists from the country going up almost tenfold since 2003.
Businesses in destinations depending on the huge numbers of Chinese tourists are already feeling the heat, with ‚Äúdeserted‚Äù beaches and shops, and concerns about the future.
The outbreak is akin to the SARS crisis, which paralyzed regional travel and battered local economies from late 2002. That time, Chinese tourist numbers declined by around a third.
In Japan, the drop in Chinese visitors has already been felt in Asakusa, a popular tourist destination near the Sensoji temple.
It will now be ‚Äúvery difficult‚Äù for Japan to achieve its target of 40 million tourists in 2020, said Yuki Takashima, an economist at Nomura Securities.
The effects will be felt beyond hotels, restaurants and tourist sites, since many Chinese tourists visit Japan specifically for shopping purposes.
However, Japan would still be better placed to weather the storm compared to another top destination for Chinese tourists, i.e. Thailand.
Tourism accounts for 18 per cent of Thailand‚Äôs GDP, with Chinese holidaymakers making up more than a quarter of total arrivals.
The country‚Äôs tourism minister has already warned a crisis similar to SARS, and it might cost an estimated US$1.6 billion, and the effects are already visible in Phuket.

There are similarities in genetic make-up between these Coronaviruses, however gene mutations in the 2019-nCoV are largely responsible for recent outbreak cases. It is therefore critical for our multiplexing assay to provide wide genetic coverage to detect and differentiate these Coronaviruses, particularly to identify 2019-nCoV for appropriate mitigation actions, if necessary.‚Äù Dr Rosemary Tan, CEO of Veredus Laboratories added, ‚ÄúThis VereCoV Detection Kit will be one of the first commercially available kits in the world with the capability to detect, differentiate and identify all 3 Coronaviruses in a single test in about 2 hours.

I wonder what it‚Äôs going to take, epidemiologically speaking, before Chinese officials responsible for providing informed guidelines and implementing/enforcing regulations on hygiene and animal welfare, start taking their jobs seriously. Doesn‚Äôt the government in Beijing understand the potential risks, even after Sars and other related viral epidemics that stem from unhealthy food production practices ?

"A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat. Most coronaviruses are not dangerous.
Some types of them are serious, though. About 858 people have died from Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which first appeared in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and then in other countries in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Europe. In April 2014, the first American was hospitalized for MERS in Indiana and another case was reported in Florida. Both had just returned from Saudi Arabia. In May 2015, there was an outbreak of MERS in Korea, which was the largest outbreak outside of the Arabian Peninsula. In 2003, 774 people died from a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. As of 2015, there were no further reports of cases of SARS. MERS and SARS are types of coronaviruses.
But in early January 2020, the World Health Organization identified a new type: 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China. By late January, there were 300 confirmed cases in China and a death count that was still in the single digits, but rising. And despite airport screenings, a traveler had brought the first case to the U.S.
What Is a Coronavirus?
Coronaviruses were first identified in the 1960s, but we don't know where they come from. They get their name from their crown-like shape. Sometimes, but not often, a coronavirus can infect both animals and humans.
Most coronaviruses spread the same way other cold-causing viruses do: through infected people coughing and sneezing, by touching an infected person's hands or face, or by touching things such as doorknobs that infected people have touched.
Almost everyone gets a coronavirus infection at least once in their life, most likely as a young child. In the United States, coronaviruses are more common in the fall and winter, but anyone can come down with a coronavirus infection at any time.

Doctors Without Borders/M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF) epidemiologists and infectious disease experts are following the fast-evolving development of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of January 30, there are more than 7,900 cases, more than 98 percent of which are in mainland China.
We have offered support to health authorities in mainland China and Hong Kong, who are leading the respective response efforts, and offering support similar to what we did in 2003 during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndome (SARS), caused by a related type of coronavirus. These activities included training of health care staff on methods to prevent and control infections and health education for vulnerable and at-risk groups.
An MSF team is being deployed to Hong Kong with an initial focus on health education for vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and other at-risk people.
Because the 2019-nCoV virus is new, much remains to be understood about it. However, as with other coronaviruses, droplet infection seems to be the main mode of transmission, so infection control measures such as handwashing and cough etiquette (covering coughs with disposable tissues or clothing) remain very important for prevention.","Real"

We strongly advise the use of hand sanitizers immediately before the Preparation of the Table and Eucharistic prayer. Do not intinct. Because hands can be as much a source of pathogens as lips, intinction is no safer than drinking and can introduce germs into the cup. Intinction (dipping the bread into the wine) can also threaten those with certain immune or allergic conditions. For instance, those with gluten intolerance for whom traces of gluten can be hazardous are at greater risk when other communicants have dipped their communion wafer into the wine. Consider receiving Holy Communion in one Kind. It is Anglican teaching that to receive the sacrament in one kind only (i.e. just the bread) is to receive the sacrament in its entirety.

The Global Biodefense market accounted for $5.47 billion in 2018 and is expected to reach $8.85 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 5.5% during the forecast period.
Some of the key factors propelling the market growth are rising investment by the governments in developed countries and technological advancements. However, less penetration in developing and underdeveloped countries is the restraining factor for the growth of the market.
By product, vaccines segment is segregated into anthrax, antibiotics, botulism, E-Bola, eye shield, immunization vaccine, nuclear/radiation, smallpox, and zika.

"Coronavirus no direct threat for Fruit Logistica Berlin How does the corona virus affect the Chinese apple market?
The outbreak of the corona virus has greatly impacted the Chinese fruit markets throughout the country. Trade in apple production areas has not yet begun. The situation is as follows:
1. Apple warehouses are filling up. The overall storage capacity in China reached a record height this year, but the actual speed with which traders are stocking their apple warehouses is relatively low, around 10%-15% slower than in regular years. Traders were quite optimistic earlier this year because the sales season is one month longer this year, however, the outbreak of the corona virus delayed the sales season by at least half a month. As the apple reserve is growing, so is the pressure on warehouse owners to sell their stock.
2. The product quality of apples in storage is problematic. Poor-quality apples can not spend a long period in storage. The overall product quality of apples is not great this year. This is particularly true for apples from production areas in the west of China. In some areas the ratio of second-rate apples is 30% higher than in regular years. This is a disaster for apple farmers.
3. Market competition only grows more fierce. Apples are not the only fruit affected by the consequences of the epidemic. Other staple fruits such as Shatang tangerines and pears, or seasonal fruit from south China such as passion fruit and mangoes, all face similar conditions. The Shatang tangerine particularly suffers. The production volume continued to grow this year, which adds extra pressure on sales. At the same time, the volume of imported fruit is also expanding. The prices of fruit are significantly lower than in previous years and the sales volumes are growing. Supply exceeds demand in the domestic fruit market. The pressure on domestic fruit is growing every year.

"From last few weeks, global markets have become very volatile and uncertain. It all has to do with corona virus which changed the financial markets into a Black swan event. Most of the Market participants and media outlets are thinking that events unfolded by virus outbreak are deeply impacting equity markets. But the reality is Its not stocks but Oil prices which are deeply getting affected by Corona Virus
Take a look at the Crude Oil 5h chart and see how closely the Price Action is related to the Events. Crude Oil Price Action Analysis on 5h Chart
Exactly when china reported a serious SARS like Viral flu affecting its citizens, Crude Oil prices fell sharply followed by the announcement. It was the beginning of Structural downtrend in Oil prices, which eventually led to 600 points downfall.
After WHO World health organization declared another high risk emergency, Crude Oil prices tumbled even further, creating multiple exhaustion gaps .
Based on these observations, its pretty clear that Crude Oil Market Sentiment and Price action is driven by news events related to Corona Virus outbreak. So whats the link between Oil prices and Corona virus?
Hypothetically, China is the largest consumer of Crude Oil. The potential outbreak of the Virus can create a potential slowdown in Chinese economic growth which in turn can impact the demand for Crude Oil. Thats one of the reasons why Oil is facing headwind.
Apart from that, During SARS epidemic in 2002 WHO and various countries implemented travel ban , this had a major impact on global oil demand. Such a scenario could play out once again because of Corona Virus.
Due to these factors Price Action is reflecting a Downtrend in Crude Oil. Hence theres a clear synergy between Price Action of Crude oil and Corona Virus outbreak. Expect Crude oil to become more volatile in coming days . Traders should keep an eye on the news events and take decisions accordingly.","Real"

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing respiratory illness in people and others circulating among animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can evolve and infect people and then spread between people, such as has been seen with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). When person-to-person spread has occurred with SARS and MERS, it is thought to happen via respiratory droplets with close contacts, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread.
The situation with regard to 2019-nCoV is still unclear. While severe illness, including illness resulting in several deaths, has been reported in China, other patients have had milder illness and been discharged. Symptoms associated with this virus have included fever, cough and trouble breathing. The confirmation that some limited person-to-person spread with this virus is occurring in Asia raises the level of concern about this virus, but CDC continues to believe the risk of 2019-nCoV to the American public at large remains low at this time.
This is a rapidly evolving situation. CDC will continue to update the public as circumstances warrant.

The authors note that the CDC and U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection began health screenings at U.S. airports on Jan. 17, 2020, to identify ill travelers returning from Wuhan City. The CDC Emergency Operations Center was activated on Jan. 21, and the process of inquiries was formalized for persons suspected of having 2019-nCoV infection. The CDC had responded to inquiries from public health officials and health care providers to assist in assessing about 650 persons thought to be at risk of 2019-nCoV infection as of Jan. 31, 2020.

"For Japan, the last decade exhibited a period of remarkable growth for tourism to Japan. The number of people visiting Japan increased from just 6.2 million people in 2011 to 31.2 million in 2018, which is a faster rate of growth over that period compared to any other major tourism destination. The relaxation of visa requirements, particularly for Chinese citizens, and a drop in the value of the yen made Japan an attractive destination.
However, after years of dramatic growth, Japan‚Äôs tourism numbers plateaued from 2018 to 2019. The stagnation was mainly due to a decline in South Korean visitors. Tourists from other major sources of visitors like China, Taiwan, and the US continued to climb. The drop in South Korean tourists was due to a trade war between Japan and South Korea.
The trade war began in July 2019, with the Japanese government restricting the export of chemical materials to South Korea that are important to the South Korean consumer electronics industry. The tensions between the two countries continued throughout the second half of 2019. In late July, South Koreans started boycotting Japanese products and cancelling visits to Japan. This had a huge impact on Japanese tourism. Japanese tourism to South Korea also dropped down, but to a lesser extent.
Japan‚Äôs tourism industry is not likely to rebound this year even though Tokyo looks forward to receive a boost from hosting the Olympics, due to a new threat amid the continuing trade dispute with South Korea. The corona virus emerging from China, and which has spread to around 30 countries, could crush Japan‚Äôs aim of hosting 40 million visitors in 2020. China, which is the biggest source of tourists to Japan, banned group outward travel in January and flights between Japan and China are sharply down.

"A foreman wearing a face mask works as a cargo ship docks at a container terminal of Qingdao port in Shandong province, China while the country is hit by an outbreak of the new coronavirus

A combination of tankers coming onto the market as sanctions are lifted (punishing companies from transporting Iranian cargo) - and the Corona virus - could depress tanker rates, says Vessels Value. Last summer, the US put sanctions on a number of Chinese Tanker owners. Due to the opaque ownership structures of the fleets, charterers stayed well clear of any vessel possibly related, thus reducing the available supply ultimately causing rates to peak at a 10 year high, Vessels Value says .
Combined with terrorist activity in the gulf, and a number of other vessels going out of service to have regulatory equipment installed e.g. exhaust gas scrubbers, the Tanker market has been looking healthy with owners enjoying the increased rates throughout autumn and winter.
There have been a number of additional downward pressures; Chinese New Year and now Coronavirus. These should have an impact on the Chinese use of Tankers, but interestingly the data isn‚Äôt showing this. See chart below with no significant downward trend. However, the full impact of the Coronavirus may not have been felt yet so prolonged continuation could present risk to Chinese oil demand, port calls and hence the tanker market.

This virus is known today as the Coronavirus or the Wuhan virus.

Hotels, airlines, casinos and cruise operators are among the businesses worst affected by the virus which has claimed 131 lives in China so far, with almost 6,000 infected worldwide.
The impact has become worse with the deadly flu-like virus striking over the Lunar New Year holiday, which is usually a booming time for Chinese travel.
The SARS outbreak struck almost two decades ago, but now what happens in China means a lot more to the world economy. In 2003, China accounted for 4.3% of world economic output. Last year, it accounted for 16.3%, as per the International Monetary Fund.
Before the virus, tourism from China was already down in part due to the Hong Kong protests and the trade dispute between Beijing and Washington.
However, in spite of that, 134 million Chinese travelled abroad in 2019, going up 4.5% from a year earlier, as per official figures. Before the outbreak, the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute predicted that around 7 million Chinese would travel abroad for the Lunar New Year this year, up from 6.3 million in 2019.
Although Hong Kong, Thailand, Japan and Vietnam are top destinations, Chinese tourists are big spenders in cities like London, Milan, Paris and New York.

"The baht has lost half of 2019‚Äôs gains in just a month, being affected by emerging market outflows and also due to spreading of a flu-like virus in China endangering the country‚Äôs tourism sector.
The baht was emerging Asia‚Äôs best performer last year, going up 8.8% against the US dollar. Since the start of 2020, the currency is now the region‚Äôs worst performer, down almost 4% as investors weighed the economic impact of the corona virus and China‚Äôs declining economy.

In addition, the company said it has applied to the FDA for emergency-use approval of the test, sending shares up as much as 24% on the news.

However, the camps are not limited to people who have traveled from overseas as most media outlets make it out to be.
One report from CBS Sacramento reveals how the military will be snatching and grabbing regular everyday citizens off the streets.
The real truth of the matter is that just like in China when the camps become full or overwhelmed many people in them start dying. In fact, the Chinese military had to build motes around the camps in an effort to detour detainees from escaping.
Keep in mind, wargaming such a scenario, one could simply be eating lunch at their favorite fast food place sometime in the near future when the military arrives and grabs everyone inside after an infected person was reported to have entered the establishment.

"Coronaviruses are types of viruses that typically affect the respiratory tract of mammals which include humans . They are associated with the common cold, pneumonia, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and can also affect the gut.
How is coronavirus transmitted? Transmission . MERS-CoV, like other coronaviruses , likely spreads from an infected person‚Äôs respiratory secretions, such as through coughing. ‚Ä¶ Infected people have spread MERS-CoV to others in healthcare settings, such as hospitals. Is the corona virus contagious? Most people will become infected with at least one coronavirus in their life. It is said that the mutating abilities of the coronavirus are what make it so contagious . To prevent transmission, be sure to stay at home and rest while experiencing symptoms and avoid close contact with other people. Does coronavirus cause death? Infection of humans with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) results in substantial morbidity and mortality , with death resulting primarily from respiratory failure. While the lungs are the major site of infection, the brain is also infected in some patients. Treatment
Protease inhibitors (eg, lopinavir/ritonavir) demonstrated antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection. Interferon alfa and interferon beta have activity against SARS-CoV in vitro and in animal models.","Real"

"Canadian company BlueDot protects people around the world from infectious diseases with human and artificial intelligence by combining public health and medical expertise with advanced data analytics to build solutions that track, contextualize, and anticipate infectious disease risks. It is claimed that the World Health Organization notified the public a viral outbreak on January 9th in China but BlueDot had sent word of the outbreak to its customers on December 31st. With centralized disease surveillance driven by artificial intelligence, billions of anonymized airline itineraries, and models to estimate local mobility, BlueDot Insights is working 24/7 to become more precise in its anticipation of the spread of infectious diseases across our interconnected world. Part of that precision is rooted in context, beyond where and how fast a disease can spread from its epicentre. Just as a pathogen requires specific environmental conditions to spread and cause an outbreak, a person's daily environment influences which diseases cause the most concern for them and those they are trying to protect. The BlueDot early warning system combines more than 100 datasets with proprietary algorithms to deliver critical insights on the spread of infectious diseases, sending near real-time infectious disease alerts based on what is relevant to the user and uses a cloud-based GIS platform integrating more than 100 diverse datasets, including global air travel and near real-time disease surveillance. BlueDot was able to predict the Zika outbreak in Florida six months before the first case and their products are used by governments in 12 countries and several hospital networks in North America. The system can also use an array of other data including an area's climate, temperature, or even local livestock ‚Äî to predict whether someone infected with a disease is likely to cause an outbreak in that area.","Real"

Also, if the demand for oil decreases and oil prices fall (the tension is not reflected in us, and we also increase our currency) A friend of mine had already told me a few weeks ago that Russia's economy would be attacked by lowering oil prices. If economic production falls in China, China's demand for oil will also decrease, which will cause economic distress to many countries, especially Iran.

By the mid-1980s, public awareness of the disease AIDS caused problems for the brand due to the phonetic similarity of names and the fact that the disease caused immense weight loss in patients.

The article is saying that the alleged "bat soup" origin of the virus from the local seafood market is shaky, at best.

China‚Äôs Global Times earlier report that the Wuhancorona virus is likely to be mutated, and the Wuhanpneumonia epidemic is at risk of further spread, has been reported in China's health commission.
Following the death of nine people due to the human transmitted virus, markets fear the return of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus that resulted in 774 deaths in 26 countries during 2002/03.
The same triggered risk-off moves on Tuesday. Also supporting the risk aversion was the US President Donald Trump‚Äôs impeachment hearing as well as the International Monetary Fund‚Äôs (IMF) downward revision to the global growth forecast.
Further strengthening the pair could be Moody‚Äôs analysis that China's shift into the current account deficit could weigh on the sovereign's credit profile. Additionally, a lack of trade-deal positive news is also a likely reason for the quote‚Äôs latest run-up.
In doing so, traders ignored calls from the Ex-People‚Äôs Bank of China (PBOC) Governor, Min Zhu, who expects China well placed for growth in 2020.
While trade/political headlines and risk catalysts are here to keep directing the pair‚Äôs near-term moves, the US second-tier data concerning manufacturing and housing will be in focus during the latter part of the day. Technical Analysis

"PEOPLE have been searching for 'corona beer virus' since the pandemic has been in the headlines, associating the beer with the pandemic.
Social media, humour sites and some bars have also been buzzing off the fact that Corona, the beer, is the prefix of coronavirus. Here's all we know. What is the corona beer virus trend?
People have been getting confused between the virus and the beer.
From January 18 to January 26, searches for "corona beer virus" jumped 2,300% globally, according to Google Trends.
Searches for "beer virus" jumped 744% in the same period, and searches for "beer coronavirus" jumped 3,233%.
People have also been making memes about the uncanny Corona prefix and one bar even threw a Corona-virus party where they sold masks with the beer. How did it start?
People started googling the virus when it hit the headlines in mid-January and the first cases were announced by China.
The virus is called coronavirus because it has little spikes on it that look like the points on a traditional crown in 2D images, like microscopes.
Corona means crown in Latin, which is the language often used in medical naming. It happens to be the same word in Spanish, where Corona beer comes from. What has Corona beer said about it?
To be clear: there is no link between the beer and the virus. The beers are not causing or linked to the virus unless you are sharing one with someone who has the virus already.
One is a delightful, light Spanish beverage that is normally served with a wedge of lime and is synonymous with beach parties and holidays in the sun; the other is a deadly pandemic causing international panic and racking up a kill count like it's John Wick.
In a stunning PR move, the brewery has sought to distance itself from the pandemic.
Assuring their customer base that they know they have a bit of common sense, a spokeswoman said: "We believe, by and large, that consumers understand there's no linkage between the virus and our business."

"Top medical researchers in China have discovered that the incubation period for the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCOV) that has wrecked havoc in the country could be up to 24 days - 10 days longer than experts previously thought.
The research was led by Dr Zhong Nan-Shan, who discovered the SARS Coronavirus in 2003 and a leading specialist advisor to the National Health Committee .
Researchers who extracted data from 1,099 Coronavirus patients from 522 hospitals in 31 provinces found that only 1.18% of patients ‚Äúhad a direct contact with wildlife‚Äù. The majority of the patients had contracted the virus from being in contact with infected people from Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak.
The study also found that only about 43.8% of those infected had developed fever, while 56.2% had remained asymptomatic until a full-blown infection creeps in at around 3 to 24 days, the norm being 3 days.
Of the patients observed in the study, more than 80% of them developed lymphopenia, which is a state where a specific white blood cell that is part of the body‚Äôs first-line of defence against diseases is reduced.
* Lymphopenia is commonly caused by infections and the flu, and usually recovers on its own after the patient made a full recovery .
The researchers concluded that the virus ‚Äúspreads rapidly‚Äù by human-to-human transmission.

Some say the numbers of death are small, while others report 100 bodies per day being burned in Chinese crematoriums, while the rest of the media, esp Youtube, "suggests" (baiting?) animal to human disease transmission by means of pest insects.

"Education Sec. Leonor Briones on Tuesday said schools are "discouraged" from suspending classes over fears that students may contract the novel coronavirus in learning facilities.
The Department of Health (DOH) recommended the decision to avoid suspending classes amid the virus outbreak, Briones told senators during a Senate inquiry.
"We have discouraged them from suspending classes because it will not prevent our learners from going to crowded places," Briones said.
Students who are already overseas before the ban are advised "to stay put" for the meantime and "comply" with health protocols once they return to the Philippines, she said.
The DOH has yet to recommend suspending graduation ceremonies either, Health Sec. Francisco Duque III said.
"That is too far off to make any recommendations to suspend or postpone... Hindi pa yan kasama," he said.
Students, especially those studying in congested classrooms, should be given face masks and other protective gear, Senator Imee Marcos said.

"A research article published in the journal ‚ÄòNature‚Äô suggests bats, not game meat to be the source of the new Coronavirus epidemic. Earlier it was doubted that the Wuhan market, in which game meat is sold may be the epicenter of the epidemic. Chinese hunters sell their priced catch mainly deers and wild Ox in the Wuhan market. But snakes, otters and all forms of exotic meat are also available in Wuhan‚Äôs central market. A new genome sequence study from a smear test done on an early patient working in the market shows the nCoV closely resembles a SARS-like virus found in bats.
The bats, the only flying mammal are considered to be at the peak of their evolution. Bats belong to the same family of dogs and its head resembles that of a fox. Lacking the major flight features typical of birds the bats utilize enormous energy to lift their heavy bodies up in the air and take flight. Their body is considered to be a reservoir of viruses although they are not affected by them.
This is because the bat‚Äôs immune system is dormant to Virus activities and as such without resistance, the virus exists in a type of symbiotic association with the host body. The high rate of exercise done by bats during flying makes their DNA strands to release through orbito-facial glands and may infect anyone with the secretions of the glands. It is increasingly worrying that the mainly fruit-eating bats may propagate the disease through fruits and vegetables consumed by humans. Scientists opinion the bats propagate viruses only when their normal habitat is disturbed . Earlier, the Nippa virus epidemic which affected Kerala a year ago had also its source traced to fruit-eating bats.
The study is not conclusive and the researchers note that other possible routes may be possible, and more patient data is needed to investigate the transmission routes further.","Real"

"Since December 2019, the outbreak of a new coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, has greatly threatened the public health in China and raised great concerns worldwide. No specific treatment for this infection is currently available. We previously reported that teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic which has routinely been used in the clinic to treat bacterial infection with low toxicity, significantly inhibits the invasion of cells by Ebola virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, via specifically inhibiting the activity of cathepsin L. Here, we tested the efficacy of teicoplanin against 2019-nCoV virus infection and found that teicoplanin potently prevents the entrance of 2019-nCoV-Spike-pseudoviruses into the cytoplasm, with an IC50 of 1.66 ŒºM. Although the inhibitory effect upon the replication of wildtype viruses ex vivo and in vivo remains to be determined, our preliminary result indicates that the potential antiviral activity of teicoplanin could be applied for the treatment of 2019-nCoV virus infection.

"The local people living near a mysterious cave in Yunnan, China was discovered to be immune to the coronavirus lethal despite them living next to thousands of bats carrying many dangerous pathogens . Researchers at the bat cave
According to the Daily Star, a secret cave filled with wild bats can hold the key to quenching the new strain of corona strain that is raging in China.
People living near the mysterious cave in Yunnan, China, have been found immune to deadly corona virus despite being living alongside thousands of bats carrying dangerous pathogens.
The exact location of the bat cave is unknown - where people living nearby carry antibodies against the corona virus
The discovery began in 2004 by SARS scientists who killed 774 people.
Experts returned to the cave in 2017 to collect bat samples - and discovered they were infected with a virus that resembles 96% of the new corona virus that causes acute pneumonia in Wuhan.
Bats are thought to be a source of corona virus infection to humans because they are widely sold in markets in China.
Bats are animals that carry a lot of dangerous pathogens
The researchers also said. 3% of people living near bats carry antibodies that protect them against corona virus family.
Although the coronary pneumonia outbreak has spread to many countries around the world and infected more than 45,000 people, more than 1,100 people have died, in many places bats are still sold as a specialty.
Salesmen in Indonesia said their bat and curry sales were stable. Mr. Stenly Timbuleng from Tomohon, Indonesia, said he still sells up to 60 bats a day. However, during the festive season, he claimed he could sell up to 600 birds a day.","Fake"

"Corona virus only lives few hours on non-living things.
according to one Malaysian doctor who answered this query, as reported by Sin Chew Daily .
Christopher Lee, a doctor from Sungai Buloh Hospital, who is also the National Advisor for Infectious Diseases in the Ministry of Health in Malaysia, gave a few reasons why he thinks it is relatively safe to accept parcels from China.
Lee said all parcels from China take at least 24 hours to reach its destination.
This shipping duration cuts the risk of transmission of the novel coronavirus, as the virus cannot survive on non-living things for long periods of time.
Lee rationalised that since 2019-nCoV is categorised as a coronavirus, the way it is spread would be similar to SARS and MERS ‚Äî coronavirus variants that are harmful to humans.
Lee was quoted as saying: ‚ÄúThe SARS virus will survive longer ‚Äî up to a few days ‚Äî in a damp or wet environment. However, on dry surfaces like plastic, the virus can only live up to a few hours.‚Äù
Referencing the SARS virus, he said pathogens will only survive outside of the human body for a few hours and up to four days in faecal matter.

PHE and National Health Service (NHS) laboratory staff have been trained to use the diagnostic kit in other parts of the county including Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, which has helped increase the testing capacity of the health agencies.
When a clinician suspects novel coronavirus, they take samples from the nose, throat and deeper respiratory tract and send them for laboratory testing. Using the diagnostic test, scientists can look for evidence of the presence of any type of coronavirus and then hone in on specific genetic clues that identify the novel coronavirus associated with this outbreak.

The death toll, which rose to 170 yesterday, is still less than half the number who died in China from SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome.
In a report published yesterday, Chinese researchers suggested that person-to-person spread among close contacts occurred as early as mid-December.

The first case of coronavirus, a group of viruses that includes some that can cause the common cold and others that have evolved into severe illnesses like SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), was reported in December. The illness apparently began in a food market in Wuhan, China, a central city in the country.

With fears increasing, face masks began selling out in China and have begun to do the same in the U.S., which has confirmed cases of the virus. But their effectiveness in preventing the spread of the virus is dependent on certain factors.
Dr. Mark Denison of Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville told the Associated Press that all viruses are small enough that they can penetrate a typical medical mask. However, he said germs don‚Äôt usually spread through the air at once; they spread through droplets from coughing or sneezing. He also noted that masks can be of some value as they block large droplets from a sneeze or cough.

How the coronavirus affects global commodity markets (CRU)
Economic slowdown is inevitable
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus is already having an impact on the Chinese economy. Millions of Chinese citizens are in ‚Äòlockdown‚Äô and the Chinese New Year (CNY) holiday has been extended from 30 January to 2 February in the entire country. However, multiple cities and provinces have ordered ‚Äúnon-essential‚Äù businesses to be suspended until 9 February, including Beijing, Shanghai and provinces nearby Hubei where the city of Wuhan is located.
There are widespread transportation bans all over the country, meaning that moving people, goods and commodities is challenging. However, cargo vessels are still allowed to discharge material at ports, but CRU understands that transportation from the ports is restricted.
Commodity markets feeling the impact
China is the world‚Äôs largest consumer of many commodities, meaning any slowdown will have a significant impact on global commodity demand and prices. Financial markets are known for their quick response to ‚Äòevent‚Äô risks and it is no surprise that most commodity prices have fallen over the past two weeks. Copper, oil and iron ore are leading the charge by falling more than others. However, China‚Äôs market share varies across products and the country is also an important producer of some commodities, such as coal, copper, aluminium, steel and fertilizers.","Real"

"The UK embassy and consulate in China will be manned by a skeleton staff from this morning as the death toll from the coronavirus soars. The government confirmed the move this morning as the number confirmed dead rose to 259 and rising.
A spokesperson said: ‚ÄòAs of 31 January, some staff and dependants from the British Embassy and Consulates are being withdrawn from China. ‚ÄòEssential staff needed to continue critical work will remain. ‚ÄòIn the event that the situation deteriorates further, the ability of the British Embassy and Consulates to provide assistance to British nationals from within China may be limited.‚Äô

China is facing deepening isolation over the epidemic with the United States and Australia leading a growing list of nations to impose extraordinary Chinese travel bans. The virus has now spread to more than two dozen nations, sending governments scurrying to limit their exposure. The United States toughened its stance Friday by declaring a national emergency, temporarily barring entry to foreigners who had been in China within the past two weeks.
Australia said it was barring entry to non-citizens arriving from China, while Australian citizens who had travelled there would be required to go into ‚Äòself-isolation‚Äô for two weeks. Similar steps have been taken by countries including Italy, Singapore, and China‚Äôs northern neighbour Mongolia. The United States, Japan, Britain, Germany and other nations already had advised their citizens not to travel to China.","Real"
"The number of coronavirus cases around the world has now surpassed 45,000 with 1,116 deaths recorded as of February 12th, 2020.
Now named Covid-19, economic fears about its spread have been increasing alongside its human toll.
The ultimate impact on the Chinese economy , as well as the global economy as a whole, will ultimately depend on how broadly it will spread and how virulent it will be.
The disease has already proven highly disruptive to China and a new Moody's forecast estimates that it will cut more than 2 percent from Chinese real GDP growth at an annualized rate in the first quarter of this year and 0.8 percentage points from growth for the entire year.
Moody's stated that the SARS experience provides a useful benchmark for assessing the economic fallout from the current pandemic.
After one year, SARS reduced China's real GDP by 1.05 percentage points while the special administrative region of Hong Kong experienced a cut of 2.63 percentage points.
Elsewhere, the impact on other countries was not as severe but it certainly was noticeable. The 1-year impact in Singapore was 0.47 percentage points while in the United States, it was 0.07 percentage points .","Real"
"The trends show that the Hamilton bar owners who advertised a coronavirus-themed promotion might have been on to something. House on Hood bar has a promotion for $6.50 Coronas and a free one-metre pizza on Friday, as long as the coronavirus "pandemic lasts". "Virus or no virus, we still think Coronas are pretty great, so while the pandemic lasts, we're selling Coronas for just $6.50, all day, every day!!" It also includes a photo of two men wearing boiler suits and gas masks while holding up Coronas. The promotion was widely criticised. The promotion has had mixed reviews by Kiwis, with some quite upset at the post. "Shame on you guys for this post House on Hood. The world is literally suffering and we've been blessed enough that we are still safe here. It's not funny at all," one person wrote. Another agreed: "How on earth do you think this is OK?! You wouldn't run a '$6.50 on all Aussie beers for the entire bushfire season' so why is this okay?!" While another wrote: "That's disgusting. I'm so embarrassed right now." John Lawrenson, CEO of the Lawrenson Group, which owns the House on Hood, didn't agree and told the Herald: "The great thing about living in today's society is that there is a small but loud minority of people who get offended by everything and I can always rely on them to get triggered. "So I'd just like to say thanks to all the snowflakes for the free advertising and thanks to everyone else with a sense of humour who liked the post."","Fake"
"Guide of the month: January 2018
Traveling gives us the opportunity to disconnect from our regular life. You get to forget your problems/issues for a few weeks, it can also help you figure things out that you would not have understood without the distance traveling can give you. We all have crazy schedules, work and a family to take care of, going away alone or with some friends can give you distance and perhaps even make you realize how important these people are for you. Like the saying says: we never know what we have until we lose it. Another great benefit is the relaxation you get to do . It‚Äôs nice to live life to its fullest and enjoy a stress free time with yourself. Going on vacation lets us recharge our ‚Äúbatteries‚Äù by disconnecting us from our regular life. When we come back we feel invigorated and we are happy to be back in our day to day routine. It‚Äôs a very good stress remover that has a lot more to give than most people are willing to accept. Traveling increases our knowledge and widens our perspective. To view new customs, different ways of living is fantastic for the mind. It gives us a new perspective about life and especially our life, it can help us change some of our habits or even create new ones. When I travel I usually make it a point to try new food, some cultures don‚Äôt have fries in their diet and they are all skinny, others use spices to give taste and not oils or fats. Discovering different values and ways to get by in life is really interesting. You also need to visit exotic new places and discover what this wonderful world has to offer.","Real"
